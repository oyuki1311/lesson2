      <h1>Banana Facts:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>All in the Name</li>
        <p> The scientific name for banana is musa sapientum, which means “fruit of the wise men.” </p>
        <li>Happy Fruit</li>
        <p> Eating a banana can cheer you up! Bananas are the only fruit to contain the amino acid tryptophan plus vitamin B6, which together help the body produce serotonin—the natural chemical which alleviates mental depression. </p>
        <li>A Healthy Choice</li>
        <p> Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fiber and are great for athletic and fitness activity because they replenish necessary carbohydrates, glycogen and body fluids burned during exercise. Plus! Bananas have no fat, cholesterol or sodium. </p>
        <li>The Adam of all Fruit?</li>
        <p> Some horticulturists suspect that the banana was the earth's first fruit. Banana plants have been in cultivation since the time of recorded history. One of the first records of bananas dates back to Alexander the Great's conquest of India where he first discovered bananas in 327 B.C.
